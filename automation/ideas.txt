Noting that square board is horizontally, vertically, bi-diagonally and rotationally symmetric, we can significantly
simplify how many board configurations to look at.

Define an equivalence class where boards are equivalent if the configuration is symmetrically the same.

Then we just need to identify the unique members of this equivalence class for a board of given dimensions.

When using the training dataset, boards in the same equivalence class can thus be treated as the same therefore hugely
increasing the value of each individual simulation.
i.e. only train on board configurations in the equivalence class and map all game scenario data points to the
equivalence class.

When determining the optimum next move when in a given configuration, we need to map the actual configuration to the
configuration present in the equivalence class, get the optimum move for the equivalent configuration, and then map back
to the actual configuration.
